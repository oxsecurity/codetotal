# Why AGPL V3 License ?

CodeTotal is an open-source and free tool graciously provided to the developer community.

We don't earn money with CodeTotal, but it takes a lot of time to maintain it, so we want to avoid companies to make money with it by selling software or services without sharing their sources, like it happened in the past with [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-aws) or [MongoDB](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/mongodb-switches-up-its-open-source-license/).

## What you can do

- Use CodeTotal with public repositories
- Use CodeTotal with private repositories, even commercial ones
- Use CodeTotal to build commercial closed-source applications
- Use CodeTotal with on-premise Git services, like Github Enterprise or Gitlab Community Edition

## What you can not do

- Sell CodeTotal
- Expose a closed-source online service that calls CodeTotal in the background

## What you could do

If you have a professional use of CodeTotal, you can be nice and support us by [sponsoring us](https://megalinter.io/latest/sponsor/), and ask your clients to sponsor us too :)
